I am a PhD Candidate at the Institute for Computational and Mathematical Engineering at Stanford University.
I joined the Stanford Neuroscience and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory with P.I. [Dan Yamins](https://web.stanford.edu/~yamins/) in September 2018 interested in biologically-inspired computational intelligence. My interests grew to include using computational models to understand how the brain works, along with recurrent models of the visual system, learning rules, and deep learning theory.

Before starting grad school, I spent two years working at a Mexican FinTech startup, teaching Computer Science, and doing research in machine learning for text mining. My non-academic interests include alpine skiing, hiking, and cooking.
